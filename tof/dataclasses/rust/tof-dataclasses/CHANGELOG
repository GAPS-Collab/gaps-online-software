#0.4.0

#0.3.0

FEATURES

* classes/functions to interact with MTB over UDP
* extends TofCommands with new commands:
  - SetRBBuffTrip : Set the trip value of the RB buffers
  - Enable/Disable forced trigger mode.

REFACTOR

* starting to implement `Serialization` traits
* errors have the proper Error traits, including 
  Display trait

DEPRECATED
* `CommandPacket` is marked as deprecated. 
  _Comment_ : Instead of having a class + packet, 
  we prefer to implment `to_/from_bytestream` for 
  each class, thus a specific "Packet" implementation
  is superfluos. 

0.2.0 

API change - 

* Rename BlobData::event_ctr to 
  BlobData::event_id, to not get 
  confused with actual event counters

NEW FEATURES

* extends BlobData with ::decode_eventid 
* introduces RBEventPayload - which is a 
  binary stream together with an event id
